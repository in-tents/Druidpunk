there are 5 parts to an effective governance structure.
1) Mythology
2) Philosophy
3) Theory
4) Structure
5) Communication

Strangely, each informs the next.

## ok so what
Well I have an alternative that still fulfills these gaps, but not from the perspective of the one filling them as they come up. I can stand on their shoulders, and it would be my honor for you to stand on mine.

1) Mythology
 * Give the ego something to be. Give it a vision worth becoming.
 * Base it on civilization cycles and working with them in an informed way.
 * Introduce archetypes, give everyone a place they can be, or even multiple places to flip flop as they change.
 * TBD
2) Philosophy
 * Pretty much techno-hippy, but more grounded in lived- versus mystical-experience.
 * I want it to be very practical
3) Theory
 * Structure - Algorithmic resource distribution through smart contracts and AI resource management - Goal: decentralize power
 * Structure - Bounty System: creates a system of defined work for defined value - Goal: decentralize power
   * PERHAPS - Bounties can be posted for free in eschange for a personal bounty of X time bank credits in a needed category. Cannot post another bounty until those credits are completed.
 * Structure - Trade school: Education in exchange for X time bank credits in that bounty category completed (no currency is owed, credits must be completed before learning a new skill) Goal: Democratize education, decentralize power
 * Communication - Delphi: App that allows communication with the AI system
 * Communication - Bounty System: clearly defines what is in demand
 * Trade - Policy Makers: trained in the philosophy and theory of Flowerpunk governance (creating smart contracts aligned with current goals, pruning off old parts that no longer reflect who we are)
 * Trade - Farmer: trained in aqua/hydroponics
 * Trade - Construction: Trained in sustainable construction

4) Structures Fleshed Out
To bypass the need to pay off the bounty in time credits, they can posted for bitcoin.
policy tokens can only be purchased with bounty credits
