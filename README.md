### With great power comes great responsibility

How do I wield my great power responsibly?

I first assume that I am nothing special, that being able to hold myself over a bug does not make it so. I have no inherent right to continue existing.

Secondly, I assume that I was not put here by mistake. There was a unique decision tree involved in creating life on this planet, guided by factors that would be put in place by the choice of who/whatever created this universe. If the universe shat itself into existence, then regardless of its ability to make choices those were the choices it made or didn't make. As some are happy to point out, not deciding is also deciding. 

Third, As a human, I am also able to make unique decision trees wich lead to novel choices. I classify that as Limited Divinity, not making the mistake of likening myself to the thing responsible for my creation, for clearly I am not.

That leads me to believe that I have power, and there are consequences to weilding it blindly and/or in self-service, therefore I have a responsiblity to learn how to use it well.

I then consider why life sucks, and why we continue to make it that way.

Life requires energy, and those who are more able to consume it do so readily since who will stop them?

But if I consume a cow, I must consider its perspective, as it has one.

"The cow is lower on the food chain, it grazes, it doesn't even eat other animals, so this doesn't negatively impact the food chain."

What if aliens came down, said "well look at these lower food chain life forms" and started eating us.

But luckily, taking energy isn't the only available way to receive it. 

Trees have excess energy, they produce fruit, which is offered for consumption in return for seed distribution.

If I take fruit, but also plant more trees by shitting into the earth, that is an equivalent exhange.

I cannot do an animal a favor by murdering it. 

I suppose I *can* do a tree a favor by trimming it, consuming or composting the organic matter, then regenerating the soil through processed organic waste.

"Why? Both involve taking something the organism didn't consent to lose. I could also do someone a favor by cutting off their leg and helping them not starve by feeding it back to them."

Equivalent exchange may play a bigger part here. One leg is not equal to the cost of one meal. The leg has utility value that can last a lifetime, the meals it provides would last the week before being consumed or rotting.

The personal suffering involved with leg removal would also be larger (probably, I have never been starving) than the suffering involved with (*ok I realize now*) my body consuming my heart.

But if the pain from cutting off my leg is exceeded by my desire to live, then I would *offer* up my leg. This does of course assume I wouldn't bleed out. If it was a self-sacrifice, that's also offering it up.

Pressuring someone to offer their leg up is not the same thing. If you are pressuring others to offer their legs, perhaps that's a good sign you should be first in line, since you are the one closest to wanting to cut off your own leg.

There is life created by the earth, then there is life sanctuaried on the earth.

The earth gives you fruit, berries, literally begging you to consume them. The animals beg you to not consume them.

Animals adapt to their environment, Humans adapt the environment to themselves. This insinuates we have a responsibility that comes with that power.

Are we responsible for creating an environment that optimizes and expands the existing harmony? Or are we responsible only for maintaining the harmony? Is there an answer, or is it up to us to decide which one is true? 

Perhaps it is both, one party making it Better, and one making sure it doesn't go Bad.

What is the most optimal way for us to suffer through existence?

You have no inherent right to continue existing.

You are able to make a novel choice. They are not. It is required of you to learn how to wield it wisely.

# Axioms:
Life costs energy, give more than you are given.

You may not take what you are not offered, you are not entitled to your desires.

You are personally responsible for learning to wield your power wisely.

knowledge is also something that can be given and received.

Can I offer knowledge in return for energy?

How much knowledge is worth how much energy? I think it's up to each individual transaction how much they are willing to give based on how much the other side is.

There is no single Right way to wield your power.

There is *kind of* a True "aligned scope" to use it in, but that scope changes because the system that it emerges from changes.

Outliers are inevitable of course.

There ARE definitely bad ways to use it though.

The point I'm trying to make is: no matter how detailed a picture I paint of the moon, it's not the actual moon, or even the whole moon.
